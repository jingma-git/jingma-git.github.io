Short Bio
======
Hi, my name is Jing Ma (麻菁). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at Zhejiang University, 
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Dongliang Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0012126#0), 
who guides me to computer graphics and 3D deep learning. 

During my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University (NEU), 
I was also fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Guibing Guo](https://guoguibing.github.io/), 
who introduced me to Deep Learning, Recommender Systems, and Natural Language Processing.

I am interested in artificial intelligence, robotics, and virtual reality.
My research goal is to develop general AI and intuitive interactive techniques. 
Currently, I am focused on making 3D generation and animation as easy as possible---
enabling the creation of virtual worlds and facilitating human interaction within them.
Recently, I am exploring next research topics and would welcome any discussions. 
Feel free to email me !
