Short Bio
======
Hi, my name is Jing Ma (麻菁). I am a Ph.D. candidate at Zhejiang University in the computer science department supervised by [Prof. Dongliang Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0012126#0). I am interested in geometry processing, computational design and interactive technique. Currently, my research focus is to make 3D modeling & animation as easy as possible.
