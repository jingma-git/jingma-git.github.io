Short Bio
======
Hi, my name is Jing Ma (麻菁). I am a Ph.D. candidate at Zhejiang University in the computer science department 
supervised by [Prof. Dongliang Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0012126#0). 
Before joining ZJU, I work with [Prof. Guibing Guo](https://guoguibing.github.io/).

I am interested in artificial intelligence, robotics, and virtual reality.
My research goal is to make AI more general and to make interactive technique more intuitive.
Currently, my research focus on making 3D generation & animation as easy as possible.
