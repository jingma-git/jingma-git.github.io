Short Bio
======
Hi, my name is Jing Ma (麻菁). I am a Ph.D. candidate at Zhejiang University in the computer science department 
advised by [Prof. Dongliang Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0012126#0), who guides me to computer graphics and 3D deep learning. 
When I was an undergraduate in NEU, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guibing Guo](https://guoguibing.github.io/), 
who guides me to Deep Learning, Recommender System and NLP.

I am interested in artificial intelligence, robotics, and virtual reality.
My research goal is to create general AI and intuitive interactive technique.
Currently, my research focus on making 3D generation & animation as easy as possible.
